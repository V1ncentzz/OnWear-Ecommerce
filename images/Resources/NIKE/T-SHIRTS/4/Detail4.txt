Updating the Legend T-shirt, this sweat-wicking tee is soft in all the right ways. We also cut it with a more relaxed, looser fit than previous versions so you can move through your reps without missing a beat.

Benefits
Nike Dri-FIT Technology moves sweat away from your skin for quicker evaporation, helping you stay dry and comfortable.
Jersey fabric feels soft and smooth.
Updated for a more relaxed feel that is slightly looser through the chest, waist and hips than previous versions.
